**1. titanic_comp**
This file contains the code for my first kaggle competetion. It was about predicting the number of survivors in titanic when it sank. I used both deep neural networks as well as Logistic regression to 
but the accuracy was about 77% in both cases. The dataset is from kaggle itself present in the competetion.
